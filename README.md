# Academic Certifications Issuing on Internet Computer Protocol Blockchain

## Overview:
This project aims to address the issue of fake certifications and duplicates in academic institutions by implementing a secure and tamper-proof certification issuing system on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. Using the Motoko language as the backend, this system allows educational institutions to register and create certificates for students, generating a unique certificate ID in the form of a hash code. The certificates can then be easily verified on the project website using the certificate ID.

## Features:

Institution Registration: Educational institutions can register on the platform to issue certifications securely.

Certificate Creation: Registered institutions can create certificates with student details, ensuring accurate and verifiable records.

Blockchain Integration: Utilizes the Internet Computer Protocol blockchain to enhance security and prevent fraud or duplication of certificates.

Certificate ID Generation: Each certificate issued is associated with a unique certificate ID generated in the form of a hash code.

Verification System: A user-friendly verification system on the project website allows anyone to verify the authenticity of a certificate by entering its unique certificate ID

## Benefits
Reduced Fraud: Blockchain technology makes it virtually impossible to create or alter certificates without detection.
Increased Trust: Verifiable certificates enhance trust in academic credentials, both for individuals and institutions.
Improved Transparency: The blockchain provides a transparent audit trail of all issued certificates.
Enhanced Security: Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized access.
